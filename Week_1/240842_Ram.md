# Edge Detection Implementation

This notebook implements an edge detection pipeline, using a series of image processing techniques to extract edges from an input image.

1. **Grayscale Conversion**: The image is first converted to grayscale using the NTSC formula, which combines RGB channels with specific weights: 0.299 for red, 0.587 for green, and 0.114 for blue.

2. **Gaussian Blur**: A Gaussian kernel is applied to the grayscale image to reduce noise. 

3. **Edge Detection with Sobel, Scharr, and Feldman Filters**: The Sobel, Scharr, and Feldman operators are used to compute the gradient of the image in both the x and y directions. These gradients are combined to calculate the magnitude and direction of edges.

4. **Non-Maximum Suppression**: A simplified NMS technique (only considering four quadrants : taking cases for every 45 degrees) is used to thin out the edges, keeping only the local maxima along the gradient direction.

5. **Double Thresholding**: A two-step thresholding technique is applied to classify edges as strong, weak, or non-edges based on their intensity.

6. **Edge Detection Hysteresis**: The weak edges are further processed by connecting them to strong edges if they are adjacent.

This approach is tested using three different filters: Sobel, Scharr, and Feldman, with results displayed for each step of the process.
